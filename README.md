# Hi, I'm an IT engineering student 👋

I'm an Information Technology engineering student (Tietotekniikka insinööri, AMK) studying in Finland, focused on building a strong foundation in software development.

My path into IT has been non-linear and intentional.

I began with a vocational background outside of technology, gained work experience early, and later made a deliberate transition into engineering and IT. From ages 12 to 15, I studied robotics and basic programming, which shaped my interest in technology and problem-solving early on.

I currently combine studies with regular work and have lived independently in a foreign country since a young age. This background has built discipline, responsibility, and the ability to stay consistent under pressure.

## What this GitHub profile is about

This profile is a learning-focused portfolio.

Here you will find:
- course assignments from my AMK studies
- practice projects and experiments
- a visible progression in structure, clarity, and problem-solving

I intentionally keep my learning process transparent to show how I approach growth and improvement over time.

---

## Technical focus

- C# and .NET fundamentals
- console applications
- programming basics (data types, conditions, loops, methods)
- clean, readable, and structured code
- version control with Git and GitHub

My priority is building strong fundamentals rather than chasing shortcuts.

---

## Work ethic and mindset

I approach learning and work with a strong sense of ownership.

I value:
- consistency over motivation
- discipline over shortcuts
- responsibility over excuses

When given a task, I take full responsibility for the outcome and follow it through.

## Looking ahead

I'm open to junior, trainee, or internship opportunities where I can grow as a developer, contribute to a team, and continue building real engineering skills.
